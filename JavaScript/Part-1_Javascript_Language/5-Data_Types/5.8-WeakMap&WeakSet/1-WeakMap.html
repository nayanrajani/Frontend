<!-- 
  WeakMap
The first difference between Map and WeakMap is that keys must be objects, not primitive values:

Compare it with the regular Map example above. Now if john only exists as the key of WeakMap ‚Äì it will be automatically deleted from the map (and memory).

WeakMap does not support iteration and methods keys(), values(), entries(), so there‚Äôs no way to get all keys or values from it.

WeakMap has only the following methods:

weakMap.get(key)
weakMap.set(key, value)
weakMap.delete(key)
weakMap.has(key)
