    Rounding
    One of the most used operations when working with numbers is rounding.

There are several built-in functions for rounding:

Math.floor
Rounds down: 3.1 becomes 3, and -1.1 becomes -2.
Math.ceil
Rounds up: 3.1 becomes 4, and -1.1 becomes -1.
Math.round
Rounds to the nearest integer: 3.1 becomes 3, 3.6 becomes 4, the middle case: 3.5 rounds up to 4 too.
Math.trunc (not supported by Internet Explorer)
Removes anything after the decimal point without rounding: 3.1 becomes 3, -1.1 becomes -1.
