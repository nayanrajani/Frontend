    Why 6.35.toFixed(1) == 6.3?
importance: 4
According to the documentation Math.round and toFixed both round to the nearest number: 0..4 lead down while 5..9 lead up.

For instance:

alert( 1.35.toFixed(1) ); // 1.4
In the similar example below, why is 6.35 rounded to 6.3, not 6.4?

alert( 6.35.toFixed(1) ); // 6.3
How to round 6.35 the right way?
