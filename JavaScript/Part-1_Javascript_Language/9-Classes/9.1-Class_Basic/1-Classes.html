            constructor() { ... }

        Then use new MyClass() to create a new object with all the listed methods.

        The constructor() method is called automatically by new, so we can initialize the object there.

        For example:
        */ 
       class User{
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        sayHi() {
            alert(this.name);
        }
       }

       let user = new User("John");
       user.sayHi();

       // rewriting class User in pure functions

        // 1. Create constructor function

        function User1(name){
            this.name = name;
        }

        // a function prototype has "constructor" property by default,
        // so we don't need to create it

        // 2. Add the method to prototype

        User1.prototype.sayHi1 = function(){
            alert(this.name);
        };

        let user1 = new User1("Nayan");
        user1.sayHi1();

<!-- What is a class?
So, what exactly is a class? That’s not an entirely new language-level entity, as one might think.

Let’s unveil any magic and see what a class really is. That’ll help in understanding many complex aspects.

In JavaScript, a class is a kind of function.

Not just a syntactic sugar
Sometimes people say that class is a “syntactic sugar” (syntax that is designed to make things easier to read, but doesn’t introduce anything new), because we could actually declare the same thing without using the class keyword at all:
