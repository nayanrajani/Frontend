        /*
        Microtasks queue
        Asynchronous tasks need proper management. For that, the ECMA standard specifies an internal queue PromiseJobs, more often referred to as the “microtask queue” (V8 term).

        As stated in the specification:

        The queue is first-in-first-out: tasks enqueued first are run first.
        Execution of a task is initiated only when nothing else is running.
        Or, to put it more simply, when a promise is ready, its .then/catch/finally handlers are put into the queue; they are not executed yet. When the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current code, it takes a task from the queue and executes it.

        That’s why “code finished” in the example above shows first.


        Promise handlers always go through this internal queue.

        If there’s a chain with multiple .then/catch/finally, then every one of them is executed asynchronously. That is, it first gets queued, then executed when the current code is complete and previously queued handlers are finished.

        What if the order matters for us? How can we make code finished appear after promise done?

        Easy, just put it into the queue with .then:
        */ 

        Promise.resolve()
        .then(() => alert("Promise Done!!"))
        .then(() => alert("Code Finished!!"));

        /*
        Unhandled rejection
        Remember the unhandledrejection event from the article Error handling with promises?

        Now we can see exactly how JavaScript finds out that there was an unhandled rejection.

        An “unhandled rejection” occurs when a promise error is not handled at the end of the microtask queue.

        Normally, if we expect an error, we add .catch to the promise chain to handle it:
        */ 

        let promise1 = Promise.reject(new Error("Promise Failed!"));
        promise1.catch(err => alert('Caught'));

        window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event => alert(event.reason));
        window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', event => alert(event.reason));
