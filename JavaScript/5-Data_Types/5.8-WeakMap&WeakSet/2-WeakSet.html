    WeakSet
WeakSet behaves similarly:

It is analogous to Set, but we may only add objects to WeakSet (not primitives).
An object exists in the set while it is reachable from somewhere else.
Like Set, it supports add, has and delete, but not size, keys() and no iterations.
Being “weak”, it also serves as additional storage. But not for arbitrary data, rather for “yes/no” facts. A membership in WeakSet may mean something about the object.

For instance, we can add users to WeakSet to keep track of those who visited our site:
