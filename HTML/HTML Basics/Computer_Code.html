HTML Computer Code Elements
HTML contains several elements for defining user input and computer code.

Example
<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
HTML <kbd> For Keyboard Input
The HTML <kbd> element is used to define keyboard input. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Example
Define some text as keyboard input in a document:

<p>Save the document by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd></p>
Result:

Save the document by pressing Ctrl + S
HTML <samp> For Program Output
The HTML <samp> element is used to define sample output from a computer program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Example
Define some text as sample output from a computer program in a document:

<p>Message from my computer:</p>
<p><samp>File not found.<br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p>
Result:

Message from my computer:
File not found.
Press F1 to continue

HTML <code> For Computer Code
The HTML <code> element  is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Example
Define some text as computer code in a document:

<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
Result:

x = 5; y = 6; z = x + y;
Notice that the <code> element does not preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks.

To fix this, you can put the <code> element inside a <pre> element:

Example
<pre>
<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
</pre>
Result:

x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
HTML <var> For Variables
The HTML <var> element  is used to define a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Example
Define some text as variables in a document:

<p>The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var>b</var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height.</p>
Result:

The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x b x h, where b is the base, and h is the vertical height.
Chapter Summary
The <kbd> element defines keyboard input
The <samp> element defines sample output from a computer program
The <code> element defines a piece of computer code
The <var> element defines a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression
The <pre> element defines preformatted text
