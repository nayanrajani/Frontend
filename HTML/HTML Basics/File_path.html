     <p>An absolute file path is the full URL to a file:</p>
     <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

     <p>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.</p>
     <img src="Images/FINAL-LOGO.png" alt="Logo" height="400px" width="300px">

     <p>In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:

HTML File Paths
A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

Relative File Paths

--><!-- 
Example
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:

Example
<img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:

Best Practice
It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).

When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.
