    Automatic Numbering With Counters
CSS counters are like "variables". The variable values can be incremented by CSS rules (which will track how many times they are used).

To work with CSS counters we will use the following properties:

counter-reset - Creates or resets a counter
counter-increment - Increments a counter value
content - Inserts generated content
counter() or counters() function - Adds the value of a counter to an element
To use a CSS counter, it must first be created with counter-reset.

The following example creates a counter for the page (in the body selector), then increments the counter value for each <h2> element and adds "Section <value of the counter>:" to the beginning of each <h2> element

Nesting Counters
The following example creates one counter for the page (section) and one counter for each <h1> element (subsection). The "section" counter will be counted for each <h1> element with "Section <value of the section counter>.", and the "subsection" counter will be counted for each <h2> element with "<value of the section counter>.<value of the subsection counter>"
